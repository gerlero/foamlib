=========================================================================

**foamlib** is a modern Python package that simplifies working with OpenFOAM cases and files by providing a standalone parser for seamless interaction with OpenFOAM's input/output data. It includes robust case-handling capabilities that reduce boilerplate code and enable efficient pre-processing, post-processing, and simulation management directly from Python.

With support for ASCII- and binary-formatted fields, a fully type-hinted API, and asynchronous operations, **foamlib** offers a streamlined, Pythonic approach to automating and managing OpenFOAM workflows.

.. note::
   **foamlib** is published in the Journal of Open Source Software (JOSS). 
   `Read the paper <https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.07633>`_ for more details about the design and implementation.
