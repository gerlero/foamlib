=========================================================================

**foamlib** is a modern Python package that simplifies working with OpenFOAM cases and files by providing a standalone parser for seamless interaction with OpenFOAM's input/output data. It includes robust case-handling capabilities that reduce boilerplate code and enable efficient pre-processing, post-processing, and simulation management directly from Python.

With support for ASCII- and binary-formatted fields, a fully type-hinted API, and asynchronous operations, foamlib offers a streamlined, Pythonic approach to automating and managing OpenFOAM workflows.

.. note::
   foamlib is published in the Journal of Open Source Software (JOSS). 
   `Read the paper <https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.07633>`_ for more details about the design and capabilities.

Quick Start
===========

Installation
------------

Install foamlib from PyPI:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install foamlib

Or with conda:

.. code-block:: bash

   conda install -c conda-forge foamlib

Basic Usage
-----------

.. code-block:: python

   import foamlib

   # Clone a tutorial case
   case = foamlib.FoamCase.clone_tutorial("incompressible/simpleFoam/pitzDaily")
   
   # Run the case
