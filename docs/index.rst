=========================================================================

`foamlib <https://github.com/gerlero/foamlib>`_ is a modern Python package that simplifies working with OpenFOAM cases and files by providing a standalone parser for seamless interaction with OpenFOAM's input/output data. It includes robust case-handling capabilities that reduce boilerplate code and enable efficient pre-processing, post-processing, and simulation management directly from Python. With support for ASCII- and binary-formatted fields, a fully type-hinted API, and asynchronous operations, foamlib offers a streamlined, Pythonic approach to automating and managing OpenFOAM workflows.
